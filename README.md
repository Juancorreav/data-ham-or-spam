## üìß Spam Email Detection Model

This notebook presents a complete workflow to develop a **spam classification model** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to distinguish between **ham (legitimate)** and **spam (unwanted)** emails through machine learning.

### üîç Key Steps in the Notebook:

- **Text Preprocessing:**  
  Cleaning and normalizing raw email text to prepare it for analysis (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation, and tokenization).
  
- **Feature Engineering with Bag-of-Words:**  
  Transforming the text into numerical feature vectors using the Bag-of-Words model, allowing the algorithm to interpret and learn from the data.
  
- **Model Training ‚Äì Multinomial Naive Bayes:**  
  Implementing a Naive Bayes classifier tailored for text data to detect patterns associated with spam messages.

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision/recall.

### üß™ Technologies Used:

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NLTK
